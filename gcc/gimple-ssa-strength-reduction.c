/* There are many algorithms for performing strength reduction on
   loops.  This is not one of them.  IVOPTS handles strength reduction
   of induction variables just fine.  This pass is intended to pick
   up the crumbs it leaves behind, by considering opportunities for
   strength reduction along dominator paths.

   Strength reduction will be implemented in four stages, gradually
   adding more complex candidates:

   1) Explicit multiplies, known constant multipliers, no
      conditional increments. (complete)
   2) Explicit multiplies, unknown constant multipliers,
      no conditional increments. (data gathering complete,
      replacements pending)
   3) Implicit multiplies in addressing expressions. (pending)
   4) Explicit multiplies, conditional increments. (pending)

   It would also be possible to apply strength reduction to divisions
   and modulos, but such opportunities are relatively uncommon.

   Strength reduction is also currently restricted to integer operations.
   If desired, it could be extended to floating-point operations under
   control of something like -funsafe-math-optimizations.  */

/* Information about a strength reduction candidate.  Each statement
   in the candidate table represents an expression of one of the
   following forms (the special case of CAND_REF will be described
   later):

   (CAND_MULT)  S1:  X = (B + i) * S
   (CAND_ADD)   S1:  X = B + (i * S)

   Here X and B are SSA names, i is an integer constant, and S is
   either an SSA name or a constant.  We call B the "base," i the
   "index", and S the "stride."

   Any statement S0 that dominates S1 and is of the form:

   (CAND_MULT)  S0:  Y = (B + i') * S
   (CAND_ADD)   S0:  Y = B + (i' * S)

   is called a "basis" for S1.  In both cases, S1 may be replaced by
   
                S1':  X = Y + (i - i') * S,

   where (i - i') * S is folded to the extent possible.

   All gimple statements are visited in dominator order, and each
   statement that may contribute to one of the forms of S1 above is
   given at least one entry in the candidate table.  Such statements
   include addition, pointer addition, subtraction, multiplication,
   negation, copies, and nontrivial type casts.  If a statement may
   represent more than one expression of the forms of S1 above, 
   multiple "interpretations" are stored in the table and chained
   together.  Examples:

   * An add of two SSA names may treat either operand as the base.
   * A multiply of two SSA names, likewise.
   * A copy or cast may be thought of as either a CAND_MULT with
     i = 0 and S = 1, or as a CAND_ADD with i = 0 or S = 0.

   Candidate records are allocated from an obstack.  They are addressed
   both from a hash table keyed on S1, and from a vector of candidate
   pointers arranged in predominator order.

   Opportunity note
   ----------------
   Currently we don't recognize:

     S0: Y = (S * i') - B
     S1: X = (S * i) - B

   as a strength reduction opportunity, even though this S1 would
   also be replaceable by the S1' above.  This can be added if it
   comes up in practice.  */

   This is legitimate for casts from a non-wrapping integral type to
   any integral type of the same or larger size.  It is not legitimate
   to convert a wrapping type to a non-wrapping type, or to a wrapping
   type of a different size.  I.e., with a wrapping type, we must
