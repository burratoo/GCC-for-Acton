# The .asm files above are designed to run on all processors,
# even though they use AltiVec instructions.  -Wa is used because
# -force_cpusubtype_ALL doesn't work with -dynamiclib.
#
# -pipe because there's an assembler bug, 4077127, which causes
# it to not properly process the first # directive, causing temporary
# file names to appear in stabs, causing the bootstrap to fail.  Using -pipe
# works around this by not having any temporary file names.
